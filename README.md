## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I populate the HTML dinamically using functions on the JavaScript, thing i just have done in my course from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), and make ID to choose the correct element in a dinamic array;

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  // Acha o botÃ£o apertado pelo index e identifica a qual sobremesa pertence pelo seu valor, que Ã© nome da sobremesa
// Find clicked button by index and identify wich dessert it belongs by your value, what is the name of the dessert
  const verifyBtn = (e) => {
    const btns = document.getElementsByClassName("dessert_btn");
    btnArr = Array.from(btns);

    let i = btnArr.findIndex((btn) => btn == e.target);

    let indentifier = btnArr[i].getAttribute("value");
    console.log(indentifier);

    getDataTo(modifyCartList, indentifier);
  };
}
```

### Continued development

I want to refine the use of dinamic array and fetch data for dinamic updates UI (User Interface). The next step i will take is learn a CSS framework, for less trouble in my futures projects ðŸ¤£.

### Useful resources

- [PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/pt-br/windows/powertoys/) - This helped me align texts in my project.
- [Responsive Viewer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/responsive-viewer/inmopeiepgfljkpkidclfgbgbmfcennb?pli=1) - This Google extension helped me visualize responsiveness in different device layouts.
